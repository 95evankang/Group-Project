### Welcome to the Group-Project wiki!


In our group wiki, we provide an overall understanding of what [high](https://github.com/95evankang/Group-Project/wiki/High-Level-Language) and [low-level](https://github.com/95evankang/Group-Project/wiki/Low-Level-Language) languages are. To see the differences of the languages please see the page titled [High-level v.s. Low-level Languages](https://github.com/95evankang/Group-Project/wiki/High-Level-v.s.-Low-Level-Languages). While both types of languages are quite different from one another there is a set of languages that are known as C/C++ which are considered by some as high and low-level languages. You can read more about each respective language level and the characteristics the two languages, C/C++, have that might allow them to fit into them.
