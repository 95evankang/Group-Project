### Welcome to the Group-Project wiki!



In our group wiki, we give the readers an overall understanding of what [high](https://github.com/95evankang/Group-Project/wiki/High-Level-Language) and [low-level](https://github.com/95evankang/Group-Project/wiki/Low-Level-Language) languages are. We all share some of the key differences between the two types of languages as well as a better understanding of the difference in the page titled [Page 1](https://github.com/95evankang/Group-Project/wiki/page-1). While both types of languages are quite different from one another there is a set of languages that are known as C/C++ which are considered by some as high and low-level languages. You can read more about each respective language level and the characteristics the two languages, C/C++, have that might allow them to fit into them.
